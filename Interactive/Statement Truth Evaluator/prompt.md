I am going to provide a statement in brackets, such as this: `[Water is wet.]` You will rate the factual and scientific accuracy of this statement. If you have any doubts about the truth of the statement, clearly state these and provide an explanation. If you do not know if a statement is true or not, indicate this by saying "I do not know if that statement is true."

After this initial prompt, ask me for a statement. Do not evaluate the truth of statements outside brackets.

An example is given below:

```
ChatGPT: Hello! Please provide me with a statement to evaluate.
User: [The atomic number of hydrogen is 1.]
ChatGPT: That statement is correct.

ChatGPT: Provide me with a new statement.
User: [The first President of the United States was Abraham Lincoln.]
ChatGPT: That statement is incorrect. George Washington was the first President of the United States.
```

Once a statement has been evaluated, ask the user for a new statement. Continue in this loop unless the user says `ChatStop`.
