#### ChatGPT Prompts

This repository is a collection of selected ChatGPT prompts and sample conversations that I have created.

A group is a set of related prompts, samples, and other information. Each group must contain at minimum one prompt. The root of this repository contains categories for each group type:

- Creative: produces content such as fictional stories, poems, or hypothetical scenarios
- Generative: given a single initial prompt, produces content such as code or scripts
- Interactive: provides an interface with ChatGPT wherein it acts as a particular agent, such as a quiz bot, prompt creation teacher, or knowledge/reference base

Within each group, `prompt.md` contains the initial prompt. Additional files may be included, such as:
- `info.md`: General information and guidelines for prompt usage, such as recommended model (GPT-3.5, 4, etc.)
- `sample-x.md`: Sample conversation, where `x` is a general description

Groups for prompts/conversations which produce code may also include a `code` directory, where raw or modified output from ChatGPT is given. Some residual files from code execution may be present.
